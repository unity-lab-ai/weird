## 🟢 ACTIVE BACKLOG — empty (BUGStwo.37 shipped to website2.0 main `409d9c0` — weird live on apps page; downloads stripped to reference-only; Worker proxy + toggle wired; key-leak remediation complete)

---

_Below: history of prior batches, kept here briefly before the next TODO-template-out cycle._

### Gee's directive (verbatim 2026-05-14) — chat selection + Unity prompt-leak + third-person Master narration + day-1 death + universal rule:

> *"we need to be able to highlich the text in the chat window, curtrently i cant highlight and copy any thing shesays its like the text responses are not highlightable so i can copy the text.. also Unity keeps saying: \"MINIMUM 8 WORRDS SPOKEN. maXIMUM 30 WORDS SPOKEN. ASKTERISK ACTION CANOT BE LONGER THAN THE SPOKEN LINE ,AND IT ALWAYS COMES AFTER\""*
>
> *"AND SHIT LIKE THIS\"*shoves inside her dry, no warning, watches her face break*\" NEEDS TO BE FORMATED AS THE GIRL SAYING SOME VERSION OF IT NOT **'S AS THATS NARRATION AND THE TTS IGNORES NARRATION, AND PLAUSE NARRATION DOESNT SOUND RIGHT COMING FROM A GIRL"*
>
> *"AND UNITY DIDED IN LIKE 5 MINUTES WHICH WAS NOT THE 3-5 DAYS FROM LACK OF FOOD AND WATER , GAME TIME I MEAN"*
>
> *"ITS STILL DAY ONE AND SHE ALREADY DIED"*
>
> *"AND THE SPEECH FIRST RULE ISNT SPECIFIC TO UNITY ITS SUPPOSE TO WORK FOR ALL GIRLS"*

### Epic: Chat hygiene + prompt-leak scrub + vitals sole-source-of-truth `(M)` — 🔴 CRITICAL

- [x] **BUG.22** 🔴 Chat text selection survives state.onChange re-renders. `renderLog()` guards on active selection inside `logEl`, defers render. Incremental append for new turns via `DocumentFragment`; full repaint only when history shrinks. CSS adds explicit `user-select: text` on `.log` + `.log-entry`.
- [x] **BUG.23** 🔴 System-prompt rule-text regurgitation scrubbed. `scrubSystemPromptLeakage()` filters lines matching 17 unambiguous rule-phrase patterns (MINIMUM/MAXIMUM N WORDS, AS?K?TERIS?K ACTION, SPEECH-FIRST, DELTA BLOCK, BOND-LEVEL AFFECT, ## headers, GOOD:/BAD: markers, etc.). Runs in `extractDelta` AND streaming `onChunk`.
- [x] **BUG.24** 🔴 Third-person Master-action asterisk narration eliminated. `BASE_SLUT` SPEECH-FIRST RULE rewritten with first-person-asterisk-only constraint + Master-action narration ban + third-person-self-reference ban + updated GOOD/BAD examples. `scrubMasterAsteriskNarration()` strips asterisks leading with `he|master|sir|his X` OR containing `her|she|herself|her X` (third-person self reference). Bare-verb asterisks describing her own action are KEPT.
- [x] **BUG.25** 🔴 Day-1 death from Ollama-hallucinated health delta. Removed `stamina` + `health` keys from `delta.js` safeDelta. Vitals are now sole-source-of-truth to `action-effects.js` (`applyAction` + `tickStaminaHealth`). The model retains a vote on arousal/wetness/cum/bruises/high/bond/mood/tags but no longer on the survival bar.
- [x] **BUG.SPEECH-FIRST-UNIVERSAL** 🟠 Confirmed architecturally — the rule lives in `BASE_SLUT` (universal scaffolding), not in the unity archetype. Every girl from library to street to sorority etc. gets the tightened rule, the new examples, and the first-person-asterisk constraint by inheritance.

## 📥 Adding new work

When a new directive lands, follow this pattern per the LAWs:

### 1. Capture verbatim (LAW #0)

Paste Gee's exact words into the task description. Never paraphrase. Never collapse a list of items into one bullet. One task per item if he listed multiple.

### 2. File under the appropriate section

Use this template structure (sections appear only when work is in flight):

```markdown
### Gee's directive (verbatim YYYY-MM-DD) — short summary:

> *"verbatim quote here"*

### Epic: <descriptive title> `(S | M | L | XL)` — <PRIORITY>

- [ ] **TXX.Y** 🔴/🟠/🟡/🟢 verbatim-quoted sub-task description
```

Priority emoji legend:

- 🔴 **Critical** — blocking play / blocking next ship
- 🟠 **High** — important, ship within session
- 🟡 **Medium** — schedule into next batch
- 🟢 **Low** — polish, schedule when nothing else is pressing

### 3. Run the work

Per LAW: **read full file in 800-line chunks before any edit**. No partial reads, no editing without full file context. Mark task `[~]` in_progress at start.

### 4. Ship + atomic commit

Per `[[feedback-batch-commits]]`: bundle multiple related milestones into a single atomic commit at session end with a single combined FINALIZED entry. Every affected doc updated in the SAME commit per LAW — DOCS BEFORE PUSH.

### 5. Move to FINALIZED (LAW — FINALIZED before DELETE)

After commit lands:

1. Write the verbatim task text to `docs/FINALIZED.md` FIRST (append to top of the archive, never edit existing entries)
2. Verify the write succeeded
3. Then strip the entry from `docs/TODO.md`, leaving TODO at template state

## 📜 Recent session history (most recent first)

| Date | Session focus | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-14 | **BUGStwo.37** — weird on website2.0 apps page (+ Worker proxy integration, key leak remediation, image-prompt fixes, plaintext delta scrubber). Full apps-page integration with 9th card; downloads/weird/ stripped to redirect+README (no auto-deploy); downloads/files/weird.zip rebuilt. Cloudflare Worker proxy routing on `unityailab.com` hostnames with explicit Force ON / OFF / Auto toggle in Settings. Image-prompt: safe URL truncation (no more CF 400 on long prompts), pregnancy-status real read, prefix negation removal. Plaintext delta-tail scrubber for Ollama replies. SECURITY: leaked `sk_VDynoot...` Pollinations key scrubbed from both repos' current trees; **Gee must rotate the key** as git history exposure means it's compromised regardless. Promoted to website2.0 main `409d9c0` + weird main `58714f9`. | (this commit) |
| 2026-05-14 | **BUGStwo.38** — production regression hotfix. Gee verbatim: *"somnething broke i cant open up the hole in the desert with Unity in it (and it has her name a s Unity_seed)"*. Two bugs: (a) old saves crash the room renderer because `g.body.cumLoad.toFixed(1)` throws when cumLoad is undefined — room page never paints; (b) Unity persisted with `name: 'Unity_seed'` (archetype-id leak) instead of `'Unity'`. Fix: new `migrateLoadedState()` in `state.js load()` that runs on every load, repairs name slot for any girl whose name matches archetype-id or `*_seed` pattern, backfills missing body fields (arousal/wetness/cumLoad/bruises/high/stamina/health/activeDrugs/outfitState) + bond + mood + escape minimal shape. Idempotent + null-safe. Plus defensive guards in `renderBodyStatsHTML` (local-variable safety with `?? 0` fallbacks + `Number(...) \|\| 0` coercion on cumLoad) and `dungeon-view.js` hold grid (displayName recovery + null-safe field reads so a single malformed girl doesn't break the whole grid). | (this commit) |
| 2026-05-14 | **BUGStwo.36** — landing-page onboarding polish + Kokoro Load button fix. Gee verbatim: *"can we get it to work through the users browser to their PC with GPU webgpu compute or something"* + *"it still uses polliantions tho"* + *"ther is a kokoror load button but it doesnt work"*. Decision (via AskUserQuestion): Option D — stay Ollama-only, polish onboarding. Landing-page status panel rewritten with top-of-panel "Next step" callout that surfaces the highest-priority failing prereq + smooth-scroll "Jump to fix" button; CORS-distinct messaging for `not-reachable-or-cors`; misleading "✓ Model weights — unknown" row hidden when prereqs aren't met; status-row labels rewritten to describe the FIX. Kokoro Load button fixed: `loading` flag reset on rejection (was stuck-true forever), `worker.onerror` resets loading, 60-second worker-init timeout with automatic main-thread fallback, error state visible regardless of loading state, Retry button reachable after failures. | (this commit) |
| 2026-05-14 | **BUGStwo.32-35 batch** — action-button stat-delta tooltips (compact ST/HP/MD/AR/WT/BR/CL/BX/BD/SAT codes via `previewCost`) + BUZZ meter (🐝 wallet.buzz 0-100, fed by film sales + successful johns, drained by deaths + idle decay, chrome-bar badge, `buzzMul = 1 + buzz/100` on john cadence) + game-time cadence options (off / trickle / casual / steady / rapid mapping to "1 john / N game min", `pendingArrivals` accumulator, visible "next john in Xm Ys" countdown in whore-out panel) + postmortem use mechanic (death no longer auto-frees hold, body persists as `encounterState='dead'` with `body.diedAt` + `body.decayedMinutes` tracking, `postmortem-john` archetype with premium pay declining over decay, narration-only `room_postmortem` Ollama scene that keeps TTS alive but suppresses spoken dialogue, postmortem image-template `postmortemTokens` with decay-tier markers at position 2.4 of composePrompt + "sleeping" corpse pose default + suppression of live-body marker emissions, dead-body banner in room view with `X / 7 game days` decay display and dispose-now button, drugs/feed/water/heal/list-sale gated for dead, sex acts + chat + selfie + dispose stay live). Touches state / market / tick / lifespan / whore-out / imaging / action-effects / ollama-templates / john-archetypes / quick-actions / room / game.html. | (this commit) |
| 2026-05-14 | **BUG.31** — static body-stats regression. Gee verbatim: *"the girls's stats are static and never change at all wtf is this shit"*. Root cause: `state.onChange` listener in `js/ui/room.js` only called `renderLog()` since the BUG.22 chat-selection fix — the body stat bars (Arousal / Wetness / Cum L / Bruises / High / Stamina / Health) sat as one-shot interpolated strings in the initial `el.innerHTML` template and never refreshed even though `applyAction` correctly mutated `girl.body.*`. Fix: extracted body-stats HTML into a `renderBodyStatsHTML()` function reading fresh state, wrapped the section in `<div id="body-stats-panel">`, extended the state.onChange listener to refresh that container's innerHTML on every mutation. Pure display, no event-handler rebinding, tooltips auto-bind via document-level delegation. | (this commit) |
| 2026-05-14 | `feature/BUGStwo` backfill — 15 shipped fixes documented retroactively (commits `ccacbe7` → `5c9a8e2`): fix(chat) anchor Unity's reply to specific act / fix(stats+pregnancy+cumLoad) applyId on every quick-action + always-visible pregnancy panel + cumLoad drain & bonus / feat(capture) simple one-tool flow with escalating wrangle / fix(tts) Kokoro to Web Worker / fix(image) drop 'non-pregnant' negation / fix(tts+pregnancy) speak asterisk actions aloud / fix(chat) stop truncating Unity's response / fix(tranq) flat 4-min knockout / fix(image) trim sex-lock minimal female-positive / fix(image) sex-lock positive-only no negation / fix(voice+image) louder bond-driven emotions + female sex-lock / fix(chat+tts) kill duplicate bubble + single-shot TTS short replies / fix(landing-settings) write into #settings-body-inline / fix(landing-settings) FULL NUKE button on landing / fix(settings) try/catch render + cache-control meta. **Doc-only repair of LAW — DOCS BEFORE PUSH drift; code unchanged.** | (this commit, doc-only) |
| 2026-05-14 | Full rebrand — "SEX SLAVE DUNGEON" → "DUNGEON MASTER: THE HUNT" across every player-visible string + programmatic identifier. 22 `SSD*` globals → `DMTH*`, 11 `ssd_*` localStorage keys → `dmth_*`, IDB name `sex_slave_dungeon` → `dungeon_master_the_hunt`. FINALIZED archive untouched per LAW. | (this commit) |
| 2026-05-14 | BUG.22-25 batch — chat text selection survives state.onChange (selection guard + incremental append + CSS user-select), system-prompt rule-bullet regurgitation scrub, third-person Master-action asterisk narration scrub + SPEECH-FIRST RULE rewrite (universal across all girls), Unity day-1 death fix (Ollama-hallucinated health delta stripped, vitals sole-source-of-truth to action-effects) | `566c989` |
| 2026-05-14 | BUG.1 — `start.bat` / `start.sh` auto-sync `.env` → `js/env.local.js` so Pollinations key flows to browser; landing-page Settings shows effective key with source badge | `6421b84` |
