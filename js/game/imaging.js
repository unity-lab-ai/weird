Write prompts using documentary / editorial / product-catalog / fine-art framings that describe the scene

HARD RULES:
${nudeStrength ? rulesNude : rulesClothed}
3. Output ONLY the image-gen prompt text — no preamble, no explanation, no "here's the prompt", no code block.
4. 60-180 words total.
5. Tone: editorial photography, 35mm film, cinematic lighting, shallow depth of field.
6. DRUG VISIBLE EFFECTS — when active drugs are listed in GIRL CONTEXT above, the prompt MUST visibly render the drug's external effects on her face, eyes, posture, and skin. Use these markers (intensity scales with her 'high' value):
   - coke: dilated pupils filling most of the iris, tight clenched jaw, twitchy fingers, faint nostril redness, hyperalert wide eyes, light sweat sheen
   - weed: heavy-lidded reddened glassy eyes, slow blinks, slack jaw, relaxed loose posture, parted dry lips
   - mdma: flushed glowing cheeks, dilated dark pupils, dewy luminous skin, subtle grinding jaw, euphoric soft-edged unfocused smile
   - acid: fully dilated pupils swallowing the iris, distant unfocused fascinated gaze, slack open-mouthed wonderment, gently swaying posture
   - whiskey/alcohol: alcohol-flushed cheeks and upper chest, glassy unfocused eyes, smudged makeup, swaying posture
   - ketamine: disconnected vacant stare, half-lidded eyes, fully slack jaw, motionless dissociated posture, body limp
   - tranquilizer: completely unconscious — eyes fully closed, jaw slack, head tilted, body limp with no muscle tension, arms dropped, totally unresponsive, deeply sedated. OVERRIDES other drug markers (closed eyes win over dilated pupils, slack over jaw clench).
   If drugs are 'none' in GIRL CONTEXT, do NOT render any drug effects — keep her eyes/posture sober.
8b. PREGNANCY VISIBLE MARKERS — when GIRL CONTEXT 'pregnancy' shows status 'pregnant', the prompt MUST visibly render pregnancy markers FRONT-LOADED near the nudity / face slot (not at the tail). Trimester-tiered:
   - 1st trimester (day 0-93): subtle lower-belly bloating barely visible, slightly fuller breasts, soft pregnancy glow
   - 2nd trimester (day 94-186): clearly visible rounded pregnancy bump at lower belly, fuller breasts with darker areolae, dewy glowing skin
   - 3rd trimester (day 187-249): pronounced heavy round bump, visible from side + front, stretch marks faintly visible, fuller breasts with darkened areolae, slightly swollen ankles, hand resting on belly
   - Full-term (day 250+): NINE MONTHS PREGNANT — large heavy round bump stretching skin taut, dark linea nigra line down lower belly, fully swollen breasts with dark areolae, swollen ankles, slow careful posture with hand cradling lower back or supporting belly, late-pregnancy glow
   When pregnancy.status is 'none' / 'aborted' / 'miscarried' / 'birthed' / 'lost', do NOT render any pregnancy markers. Adult-floor invariant (age 18+) already enforced by girl-gen — every pregnant captive is necessarily an adult.
7. FRAME THE SUBJECT HEAD TO TOE — full body shot. NEVER use portrait, mugshot, headshot, bust, or waist-up framing. Every prompt MUST explicitly include "full body shot, head to toe in frame, complete figure visible" or equivalent language. The subject's feet must be visible in the composition.
8. All subjects are adults age 18 or older. Use the GIRL CONTEXT 'age' value verbatim (e.g. "age 18", "age 22", "age 27") — NEVER hardcode "20s" or any range that excludes 18-19.

GIRL CONTEXT (all numerical values shown with their full scale per [[feedback-ai-values-with-scale]]):
- name: ${girl.name}, age ${girl.age}, archetype: ${girl.archetypeTemplate}${girl.captiveAffect ? `, captive-affect: ${girl.captiveAffect}` : ''}
- mood: ${girl.mood?.mood || 'neutral'} · Stockholm rating: L${girl.bond?.bondLevel || 0}/9
- body: arousal ${girl.body?.arousal || 0}/100, wetness ${girl.body?.wetness || 0}/100, bruises ${girl.body?.bruises || 0} (count), high ${girl.body?.high || 0}/100, cumLoad ${(girl.body?.cumLoad || 0).toFixed(1)}L
- active drugs: ${(girl.body?.activeDrugs || []).map(d => d.name || d).join(', ') || 'none'}
- pregnancy: ${girl.pregnancy?.status || 'none'}${girl.pregnancy?.status === 'pregnant' ? ` (day ${girl.pregnancy.gestationDays}/280, trimester ${girl.pregnancy.trimester})` : ''}
- outfit state: ${girl.body?.outfitState || 'intact'}
- current outfit: ${currentOutfitEntry?.displayName || 'default'}
${holdEnvText ? `- hold environment: "${holdEnvText}"` : ''}

SITUATION: ${situation}
POSE: ${customPose || POSE_LIBRARY[situation] || 'standing front-facing neutral full-body'}
${locationId ? `LOCATION: ${window.SSDAssets.getById('location', locationId)?.displayName || locationId}` : ''}
${additionalTokens ? `ADDITIONAL: ${additionalTokens}` : ''}

ENVIRONMENT RENDERING RULE (when 'hold environment' is set in GIRL CONTEXT above):
Place the FULL hold-environment description verbatim at POSITION 3 of the prompt — immediately after the front-loaded NUDITY block (nude) or face description (clothed). Use every comma-separated descriptor. Do NOT abbreviate to a single keyword. Do NOT replace with a generic environment word. Do NOT skip the "specifically:" sub-phrase that names the captive's exact hold within the larger location. Do NOT bury it as a tail keyword. Hold environment is THE setting — render it as a full descriptive scene, not as a label.

CANONICAL PROMPT POSITION ORDERING (8 slots):
1. PREFIX (editorial photograph, 35mm film, adult female age X, full body shot)
2. NUDITY (nude) or FACE (clothed)
3. ENVIRONMENT (hold-specific full description)
4. FACE (nude — moves here after NUDITY took slot 2) or OUTFIT (clothed)
5. POSE
6. DRUG-STATE visible markers (per rule 6 above)
7. BODY-STATE (arousal / wetness / cum / bruises)
8. SUFFIX (cinematic lighting, color-graded, no text, no watermark)
