# SEX SLAVE DUNGEON

> *persistent city-builder — dungeon harem evil taboo — hunt your prey with the purchased tools and items.*

A massive multi-page text+emoji adult game. Runs entirely on your machine — no servers, no accounts, no telemetry.

- **Ollama** (local LLM) drives every girl's persona — real inference, no canned strings.
- **Kokoro TTS** runs in your browser for sentence-queued voice.
- **Pollinations** (optional, bring-your-own-key) generates per-girl portraits + on-demand selfies.
- **IndexedDB** stores your save in your browser.

Static site. Deploys to GitHub Pages unchanged. Zero build step required.

## Local test run (no hosting required)

Double-click **`start.bat`** on Windows (or run `./start.sh` on Mac/Linux). It:

1. Checks for Ollama on your PATH, launches it in a new window with `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*`
2. Finds a local web server (Python / Node / PHP — whichever is installed)
3. Starts serving on `http://localhost:8080`
4. Opens your browser to the landing page

Close the server window to stop.

---

## First-time visitor setup

> 🚧 The current `index.html` IS a setup wizard that doubles as the landing page. ROADMAP Phase 21.12 replaces this with a real public landing page (Start New Game / Continue / Settings / About / Terms / Privacy), with the setup wizard gated behind "Start New Game" for first-time visitors only. Until that ships, the flow below applies.

Open the landing page (`index.html`). It walks you through:

1. **Install Ollama** — one command per OS. The site detects when Ollama comes online.
2. **Pull a model** — pick from the preset uncensored / abliterated catalog (Dolphin Mistral 7B recommended). Progress shown live.
3. **Load Kokoro** — ~80MB model weights downloaded once to your browser, then cached forever.
4. **(Optional) Pollinations key** — paste your free API key from <https://pollinations.ai> for images.

Once the four status pills are green, LAUNCH.

### CORS note

Ollama needs to allow this site's origin. Set the env var before starting Ollama:

- **Windows (PowerShell):**  `[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("OLLAMA_ORIGINS","*","User")`
- **Mac:** `launchctl setenv OLLAMA_ORIGINS "*"`
- **Linux:** `export OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*` (or add to your Ollama systemd override)

Then `ollama serve` (or launch the Ollama app). The setup wizard explains this per your OS.

## What's under the hood

### Game systems

> 🚧 = in development per ROADMAP Phase 21 (2026-05-14 major-systems overhaul). Unmarked bullets describe systems currently shipped and running in the live build.

- **Real Ollama inference per girl** — base slut scaffolding + 7 archetype overlays (unity / library / club / street / sorority / gym / barista) + 🚧 a **captive-affect personality dimension** layered on top (mute / cusser / fighter / submissive / agreeable / bargainer / catatonic — drives HOW she resists captivity, separate from her pre-capture identity) + 3 mode overlays (sexy / hurtme / sexy-with-damage) + 13 scene prompts (first encounter, capture attempt, room arrival, room regular, recording, bond milestone, escape caught, 4-beat capture transition, disposal scenes, propositioner scenes, escape recovery).
- 🚧 **Speech-first first-person response shape** — every model response leads with the spoken line (8-word minimum) and trails with an `*asterisk action*` shorter than the speech. Asterisk actions get stripped before TTS, so the speech-first rule guarantees Kokoro speaks real first-person content instead of a lonely `"yes Master"` after a long third-person narration.
- 🚧 **Forced chemical-state effects in speech** — when a girl has active drugs, every line of her response carries the drug's signal (sedatives: slurred consonants + mid-sentence drops; coke: rapid-fire short phrases + jaw lock + sniffs; weed: long pauses + drifty word choice; mdma: emotional flooding + tactile fixation; acid: things-aren't-real sensory leak; alcohol: slurred and loose). Drug names never spoken — the rhythm and slur IS the signal.
- **Structured delta parsing** — every model response ends with a `<delta>{...}</delta>` JSON block that updates body / mood / bond / stats / tags. Tolerant parser handles `L`-suffix, single quotes, unquoted keys, missing closing braces.
- **Sentence-aware Kokoro TTS playback queue** — splits responses on `. ! ? …`, generates each clip via in-browser Kokoro, plays sequentially with the next sentence pipelined-generating behind it. Cancels cleanly on new turn / voice-off toggle.
- **Self-healing Ollama corruption flow** — detects when Windows Storage Sense / cleanup tools wipe the multi-GB model blob (leaving manifest behind). On detection, opens an in-game repair overlay that DELETES the stale manifest entry first then re-pulls fresh — no PowerShell needed.
- **Persistent visual identity per girl** — Pollinations seed + locked facial description + locked outfit description per generated girl. Every subsequent image of her (profile, hunt thumbnail, room scene, selfie, milestone memorial) reuses those locked blocks so her face and baseline outfit stay consistent across every render.
- 🚧 **Drug-state visible in every image** — coke shows dilated pupils + jaw clench + red-rim nostrils + twitchy fingers; weed shows glassy red eyes + half-lidded slack lips; mdma shows wet-shine pupils + temple sweat + working jaw; acid shows thousand-yard stare + parted lips; ketamine shows glassy distance + slack posture + soft-open mouth; sedatives show drooped eyelids + slack body. Markers scale with each drug's active magnitude.
- 🚧 **Per-hold environment description in images** — every dungeon template carries a `holdPrompt` (e.g., for the buried desert pit: *"heavy forged iron ring set in the pit floor, attached chain with a steel cuff"*; for the cinderblock cell: *"steel bed frame bolted through the concrete floor with cuff rails at all four corners"*; for the sewer alcove: *"brick alcove with a heavy forged iron ring anchored into the masonry, chain with cuff"*) which gets composed into the image prompt at position 3 (immediately after face/nudity) — every captive in every hold gets her own specific hold rendered as the background, not a generic "hole in the ground" keyword buried at prompt-tail.
- **Drug scheduler with pharmacokinetic curves** — 7 substances (coke / weed / mdma / acid / whiskey / ketamine / alcohol) with onset / peak / wear-off curves driving `body.high` over real time.
- **9 predator hideout templates** — hole-in-the-desert, woods-container, basement-hidden-room, subway-service-room, sewer-tunnel-locked, coldwar-bunker, abandoned-mine-shaft, remote-compound, underground-complex. Each with isolation / concealment / hold-type / capacity-upgrade-chain.
- 🚧 **12-track per-hold upgrade ladder** — security / restraints / lights / toys / food-quality / toilet (can → bucket → full plumbing) / **water-supply (manual bottle → wall jug w/ straw → plumbed faucet → recirculating IV)** / **feed-automation (manual → auto-bowl timer → auto-feeder dispenser → IV-line continuous)** / bedding / entertainment / decor / climate. **Plumbed toilet (tier 2) eliminates the water-supply requirement entirely**; auto-feeder (tier ≥ 2) draws from a bulk `feedReserve` so the player stops manually refilling. Maintenance-free holds at the top tier.
- 🚧 **Bottled + filtered water in the shop** — `bottled-water` (24pk, $8) and `filtered-water` (5gal, $18). Water consumable decay gates on hold's toilet + water-supply tier, so plumbed holds stop charging the player.
- 🚧 **Pregnancy subsystem** — conception rolls fire when `cumLoad` crosses threshold on a turn and no condom-on outfit equipped, gated by fertility curve + drug-protection factor + bond level. Pregnant girls progress through gestation (0-280 days) with an in-room Pregnancy panel showing status + days. Abortion items available: `condom` ($2 stack, preventive), `plan-b` ($25, early), `abortion-pill-medical` ($120, first trimester), `surgical-kit-back-alley` ($200, later, risk), `obgyn-referral-clean` ($600, clean professional). Failure to abort and not buying anything = full-term outcome: birthed → child added to roster as separate entity OR sold to slave market OR lost to authorities (per-roll). Coat-hanger fallback exists for desperate plays — severe lifespan hit.
- **Episode recording + content market** — every interaction is recordable as a film, priced by bond level × content intensity × girl rarity × dungeon aesthetic × uniqueness × wardrobe multiplier, listed in a procedural-buyer market that auto-sells per tick.
- **Propositioner business sim** — NPC clients arrive with archetype quirks + budget + duration + acts wanted. Player picks which girl, negotiates price, accepts. Engagement resolves with body/mood/bond/money/notoriety deltas and Ollama-narrated scene from the girl's POV.
- **Slave market** — buy + sell girls. Price formula scales on bond, stats, wardrobe, rarity. NPC listings refreshed per tick.
- **Disposal mechanics** — bury / incinerate / release / trade / finalization-film. Each with notoriety / suspicion / income consequences and an Ollama-narrated final scene.
- 🚧 **Capture loop with spam-mitigation** — repeated tool-use attempts at the same target compound cost: per-attempt suspicion bump (geometric scaling, 3rd attempt at same location triggers cops-risk roll), per-attempt stamina drain (regens per-tick), per-attempt girl-flee escalation (1st = caught off guard, 2nd = backing away, 3rd = sprinting / screaming for witnesses), per-tool cooldown at the same location, witness pool roll on every attempt, single-use sedation items consumed per attempt. Successful captures play a 4-beat Ollama narrative (subdue → transport → arrival → first conscious moment) factored by tool × archetype × source location × destination hideout.
- **40+ preset click actions** — bond-tiered quick-action banks (low-bond / mid-bond / high-bond / hurtme / drugs / commands) so the entire game is one-handed mouse control.

## Local development

```bash
# serve the static files (any local server works)
npx http-server . -p 8000
# or: python3 -m http.server 8000
```

For dev-time auto-injection of a Pollinations token (so you don't have to paste it into Settings every time you wipe storage), copy `js/env.example.js` to `js/env.local.js` and fill in your token. `env.local.js` is gitignored.

### Regenerating the README screenshots

```bash
npm install playwright
npx playwright install chromium
node scripts/screenshots.mjs
```

The script walks the entire game, sends a real Ollama turn, requests a real Pollinations selfie, and waits for each to actually complete before screenshotting. Non-headless so you can watch it play.

## Privacy & Data

Nothing leaves your machine except:
- **Ollama calls** → your own local Ollama instance at `localhost:11434`. 100% local.
- **Pollinations calls (optional)** → `pollinations.ai` with *your* API key. Only if you opt in.
- **Kokoro model download** → from a public CDN on first visit. Cached forever after.

The static site itself (served from GitHub Pages) loads once. All game state, saves, and generated content live in your browser (IndexedDB) and on your disk (if you export saves).

## Architecture

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full system design.

See `docs/TODO.md` for active work + `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the 20-phase build plan + `docs/SKILL_TREE.md` for the capability matrix.
